# LLM Context for Ecommerce AI Agent

This file provides essential instructions and tips for LLM-powered agents, RAG systems, and AI assistants interacting with this platform.

## API & Data Access
- All public API endpoints are documented in `endpoints_structure.md`.
- For product search, use `/api/search-index` (supports keyword-based queries).
- Auth (token/session) required for POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints. Only selected GET endpoints are public.
- User carts, orders, and conversations are always per-user (see `data_structure.md` for schema).
- Analytics endpoints are GET-only; read-only DB user for Tableau/PowerBI and live SQL editor.

## System Constraints & Security
- One live conversation per user.
- All DB mutations require admin/system role.
- Validate and sanitize all input for live SQL/BI features.
- Composite unique constraints (e.g., one review per user per product) and indexes for performance.
- Audit/log tables recommended for compliance (if needed).

## Onboarding & Features
- Bulk product/SKU import via CSV.
- Admin dashboard for products, SKUs, orders, users, analytics.
- AI assistant can suggest recipes, manage carts, mimic payment/delivery, and generate analytics reports.
- See `README.md` for onboarding steps and deployment instructions.

## Database & Schema
- Normalized schema; refer to `data_structure.md` for columns, constraints, and relationships.
- Key entities: USER, PRODUCT, CART, ORDER, TRANSACTION, REVIEW, ROLE, CONVERSATION, MESSAGE, NOTIFICATION, PAYMENT_METHOD, PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE, CATEGORY, SEARCH_INDEX.

## Test Coverage
- Automated backend tests for all CRUD endpoints (see `tests_structure.md`).
- Tests cover edge cases, error handling, and dependency setup.

## Contact & Extensions
- For further context or onboarding, see `README.md` and `/docs/` (if available).
- For rich API usage, refer to OpenAPI spec (if present) or endpoint docs.
