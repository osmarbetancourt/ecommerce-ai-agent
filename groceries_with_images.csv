Pressed Juicery is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no preservatives and no added sugars.
Roots - We've blended carrots and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Known for their rich color and sweet flavor, root vegetables contain powerful benefits that promote liver health, fight free radicals, soothe the nervous system, protect your eyesight, and more! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates, which help the body to break down sugar.
Citrus Juices - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that are known to stimulate and alkalize the system, aid in digestion, and provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down.
Green Juices - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Leafy green vegetables are known for their antioxidants, phytonutrients, as well as enhancing oxygen transport and serving as a natural source of energy. Our green juice is perfectly blended so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition.
Shots - Our shots pack a powerful punch of fresh pressed ingredients that you can feel working! Throw one back for a quick pick-me-up or pour over your favorite juice for an extra boost of flavor. Cold pressed juice and shots

Orders will ship Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for delivery Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Orders placed after 12 pm PST on Tuesday will not ship until the following Monday. Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no added sugars. How to cleanse: Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking one 12oz juice every 2 hours in the following order: Avocado Greens Juice, Refreshing Citrus Juice, Roots with Ginger Juice, Greens with Ginger Juice, Sweet Citrus Juice, Strawberry Orange Mango Juice. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse. Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste. Refreshing Citrus - Light, revitalizing and fresh, with just the right amount of sweetness. Pineapple and lemon are balanced with hydrating aloe vera water & coconut water to bring you 680mg of potassium, 15% of your daily value. Roots with Ginger - We've blended ginger and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates. Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition. Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down. Strawberry Orange Mango Smoothie: Skip the blender and go straight to refueling with our Strawberry Orange Mango Smoothie! The fruit-based smoothie is delightfully refreshing thanks to apple, orange, strawberry, mango, and peaches, while lemon, elderberry, and vitamin C boost your system from the inside out. Wellness Shots
