Orders will ship Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday for delivery Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Orders placed after 12 pm PST on Tuesday will not ship until the following Monday. Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no preservatives and no added sugars. How to cleanse - Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking 1 juice every 2 hours in the following recommended order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse. Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Leafy green vegetables are known for their antioxidants, phytonutrients, as well as enhancing oxygen transport and serving as a natural source of energy. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition. Orange Turmeric - Orange Turmeric is a blend of orange, apple aloe vera, turmeric, lemon, and black pepper. Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji. Roots with Ginger - We've blended carrots and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Known for their rich color and sweet flavor, root vegetables contain powerful benefits that promote liver health, fight free radicals, soothe the nervous system, protect your eyesight, and more! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates, which help the body to break down sugar. Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that are known to stimulate and alkalize the system, aid in digestion, and provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down. Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste. Wellness Shots\nThese shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne. Ginger's spicy goodness contains anti-inflammatory properties that help with circulation, aid in digestion by soothing the stomach and support glowing skin and circulation. Vitality Shots\nThese shots are milder than the wellness shots, sweet and spicy with an earthy aftertaste. Turmeric takes the spotlight here containing a compound called curcumin. Benefit from the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of curcumin to relieve joint pain and muscle aches. 24 Bottles - 18 Juices (12 oz), 6 Shots (2 oz) 6 Greens with Ginger\n3 Orange Turmeric\n3 Roots with Ginger\n3 Sweet Citrus\n3 Avocado Greens\n3 Wellness Shots\n3 Vitality Shots All natural fruits and vegetables\nNo sugars added\nNo preservatives\nHigh-pressured processed (HPP)\nKosher\nIndividually labeled\nKeep refrigerated", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/4040602/pexels-photo-4040602.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}
