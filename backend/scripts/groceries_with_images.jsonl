How to cleanse - Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking 1 juice every 2 hours in the following recommended order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse.

Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji.

Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no added sugars. How to cleanse: Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking one 12oz juice every 2 hours in the following order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse. Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition. Orange Turmeric - Orange Turmeric is a blend of orange, apple aloe vera, turmeric, lemon, and black pepper. Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji. Roots with Ginger - We've blended ginger and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates. Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down. Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste.

Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse. Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste.

INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.​Twist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn’t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/g5663da83e953b7b308ef4413e26c0a7837cdab906563833542d62230cf7f0e31e90546703054353d9b45b60b412aa3687537bd0c14722079d0055beb671a2c28_1280.jpg"}

That single coffee shop became such a favorite that more locations soon began to open in neighborhoods across Canada, then the US, and now parts all over the world.

Spain is the second most mountainous European country after Switzerland, and so Serrano Ham is produced all over the country.When we talk about Serrano ham we do not refer to the general denomination of “cured ham from pigs raised in mountain areas” but, specifically, to a special ham category: which is one that comes from the white pig. The white pig is the result of the crossbreeding of Landrace, Duroc-Jersey, Large White and Blanco Belga, among others. These white pigs are fed with natural fodders, composed of cereals. Their young are controlled until the moment of the animal sacrifice, at the age of about 6 or 7 months, with an approximated weight of 95 to 100 kg.Spain has been producing cured hams for many centuries. Ham is a rooted product in the Spanish history and it can be considered as an essential factor of its culture.The Serrano Ham is produced according to traditional methods that award it a sweet and slightly aromatic palate. Its flavor and its sensory characteristics make it a gastronomic product of its highest quality, guaranteed by a traditional process and a good selection of raw material.Ingredients:Pork ham, sea salt.Storage Conditions:May be refrigerated. Store in a cool and dry place.Consumption:Ham should always be eaten at room temperature (57ºF at 71ºF).After carving, lay the slices on a wooden board and allow them to breathe for at least thirty minutes. This intensifies the flavour for a truly authentic taste. In Spain, Serrano Ham is usually eaten as a \"Tapa\". That is to say, as an aperitif, in small and very thin slices and perhaps accompanied with bread and a red glass of wine or a beer. But Serrano Ham, due to its excellent quality and gastronomically qualities, has inspired renowned chefs around the world to prepare all kinds of recipes (from the simplest to the most sophisticated).", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/g998671a15f48f757c1d7ab592d2826d6c59ba8f65ea7c5f3eac35f8eba1e7bf98b8eac21157b0a54e21e580d0acf47fd888a7dba2e3c42d4816b034549e0e101_1280.jpg"}

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter. Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin. Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers. That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping. What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you. Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/gad5a4d1d494eef085dbebe204cb27e86204ca222715782adf29c27fc7efcf56f1b7d208440c275b8d219c8239e9b9204b2d4da2ba27eec24138bd0f4a5559b05_1280.jpg"}

American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from a small percentage of Certified Black Angus. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one steak. American Wagyu Beef Patties, 2 Patties, 8 ounces each. Like the Wagyu beef filets, our burgers come from humanely raised cattle on small family ranches in the west. The Wagyu cattle live on pasture, never receive antibiotics or hormones and are finished in the traditional Japanese way: with incremental amounts of grain that encourage their natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling. 75% Lean, 25% Fat USDA Choice Bone-In Ribeye Steaks, 2 Steaks, 20 -22 ounces each. These Choice-grade Angus steaks are wet-aged for 21 days to add complexity to the flavor.

As if 3 amazing varieties of fantastic beef weren’t enough, this gift box also comes with gourmet accompaniments to help create the perfect steak dinner! Black Truffle Butter is a silky creamery butter blended with real black truffles which adds a robust and earthy flavor to elevate steaks to the next level! Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture. The perfect base for any sauce. Dried Wild Mushroom Mix is packed with flavor and once reconstituted, makes a great topping on the steaks and burgers. Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)! Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them\nFilet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare\nSeason steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine\nMake a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked. Scrape up any browned bits remaining in the pan while demi-glace is reducing. Cook until sauce is a syrupy consistency; stir in some truffle butter to finish.

Since 1892 when our great grandfather, Enrico Scoppa and our great grand-uncle, Antonio Ferrara, opera impresario and showman, opened a cafe called Café A. Ferrara in Little Italy section in New York City we have prided ourselves on creating superb Italian specialties. We take the extra step of baking two, three and sometimes four times a day, in small batches. Because of the frequency with which we bake, Ferrara acquired our great reputation for quality and freshness. Today, Ferrara is still a family-owned business operated by the fifth generation. That’s perhaps the most wonderful thing about Ferrara. Since its beginning in 1892, the spirit, recipes and devotion to quality has changed very little.Includes:2 lb Assorted Italian Cookie Tray16 oz.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/ge344474334156237060ca1eb9f3c0e7957ce772da50d0ea6267f7690fdbed2257bcdac81112b1ce7de451953c90e9155d3e4db5212fa08e9d8d4d48e2aace22a_1280.jpg"}

These heritage-breed chickens are exclusively raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community, in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones - for twice the time of an average chicken. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter. Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin. Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers. That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping. What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you. Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness.

When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness. Recommended minimum internal temperature is 145°F, which should be measured at the thickest part of the portion.Serve immediately: Enjoy your salmon immediately. Leftovers will keep refrigerated for about 5 days, and can be gently reheated in the microwave", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/g5f0ea25ec19954c66d2d93331ea77db8178d45a2154254fa28755c774facbaac18ab2909d35914f8d0158fd5b878b8d805f89b39deb532d240fdc0d7869dbbf8_1280.jpg"}

Responsibly caught in the wild by longlines, this premium tuna fish is dolphin-safe and the perfect choice for your poke party.\nPoke, which rhymes with okay, is a famous raw fish salad from Hawaii that has been gaining fans around the world. This quick and easy one-bowl meal is made with flexible ingredients so that each bowl can be tailored to individual tastes. Raw tuna is the crowning glory of any poke bowl, and only the best quality will do, just as with sashimi.\nBegin your poke bowl with warm rice - brown, white, wild, or short-grain - and add layers of raw vegetables including chopped sweet onion. Make it your own with cucumber, edamame, daikon, or shredded carrot. The cubed tuna should be dressed and briefly marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a little honey. For those that like it hot, add sriracha or red pepper. Slices of creamy avocado make a great addition, along with seaweed salad, or crumbled nori.\nMake poke keto or paleo-friendly by replacing the rice with riced cauliflower, or skipping it altogether and adding more vegetables. Raw and refreshing, this tropical treat is hyper-healthy and allows you to play with color, texture, and flavors each time you create a bowl.\nPoke is an outside-the-box solution for summer gatherings or quick family meals. You will be well prepared for quick and easy meals with this ready-to-eat chopped tuna.\nNot ready to go raw? Quickly pan-sear the cubed tuna and serve over rice, noodles, or stir-fried vegetables. Elevate a tuna wrap with seasoned and lightly seared yellowfin cubes instead of the canned stuff. Any salad will be transformed by seared tuna cubes - even a classic Nicoise salad with green beans, potatoes, and hard-boiled eggs.\nTo thaw: Place frozen poke cubes in the refrigerator the night before you plan to prepare your meal. Once thawed, open the package and pair it with your favorite accompaniments.

Hanger Steaks 3 Packs of 2 8 Oz. Bavette Steaks 2 Packs of 1 12 Oz. NY Strip Steak", "Product Description": "D’Artagnan’s ABF Butcher Box Collection provides ample opportunities to make restaurant-quality steak dinners at home. With three different types of steak included, you’ll expand your repertoire at the grill or in the kitchen.\nThis impressive gourmet package includes single-portion bavette, hanger, and NY strip steaks. Each steak is individually butchered, trimmed, and vacuum-sealed for your convenience. Keep them in the freezer until the mood strikes or a party gathers. Bavette steak - also known as sirloin flap - is a cult favorite with butchers and chefs and is often hard to find in grocery stores. This well-marbled steak is similar to flank and skirt cuts, although much beefier and more supple than either. Try marinating bavette steak and then searing or grilling it. Be sure to slice it against the grain to best enjoy the texture and rich flavor.\nHanger steak is nicknamed butcher’s steak because this especially tender and flavorful cut was so often held back to feed the butcher’s family. The cut is from the short plate under the ribs - a muscle that does little work, so it has a lush texture. Whether you are an accomplished chef or a beginner, pan-searing and grilling hanger steak over high heat is easy, and rewards with a flavor similar to ribeye.\nNY strip steak is among the most popular cuts of beef and comes from the short loin. With its tender texture, the strip steak is a favorite of steakhouses and countless backyard grillers. Enjoy strip steak with eggs for a hearty breakfast, crusted with pepper and pan-seared, or seasoned simply and grilled to rare or medium rare. D’Artagnan beef comes from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus breed cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones, or any other artificial substances. They grow slowly and naturally, so the cattle take a little longer to come to market, but that’s fine with us. A stress-free lifestyle produces tasty results. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be.

Each bite you will experience an unbelievably tender, intense flavor and mellifluous, “melt-in-your-mouth” texture. Authentic Wagyu's Japanese A5 is imported from Kagoshima, Japan which is located in the far south of Japan. The Kagoshima prefecture is collectively responsible for around 20% of Japan's Kuroge Wagyu cattle, the Wagyu breed that produces Japanese A5 Wagyu. Kagoshima's consistent temperate climate and ecology are well-suited for raising healthy cattle with low stress levels, a necessary component of achieving A5 quality.

The Japanese beef grading scale is quite different than the USDA scale of Select, Choice and Prime. In Japan, there are 12 different categories of beef quality. With the “A5” selection being the best of the very best.Authentic Wagyu in partnership with Costco, has secured this exquisitely distinct beef utilizing their direct relationships with the farmers of Japan, their genetics and mythical process of cattle raising that has been passed down from multiple generations.

This unique characteristic is the fruit of GOLDEN NEST®, commitment to have all swallow nests be 100% hand-washed and 100% bleaching-free. The 100% hand-washed method is still the time-tested premier method to minimize the impurities content in the nest. This method, however, is losing its popularity due to significant product loss during the cleaning process. Also, some minor impurities might still remain visible, due to the absence of bleaching agents to ‘cover’ them (read: ‘Why Bleaching’ at the back page). However, GOLDEN NEST® believes that the best swallow nest should always be completely natural; to achieve a 100% natural final product, 100% hand-washed raw swallow is the unwavering, ultimate standard. Finally, the absence of bleaching agents, along with advanced cooking technology similar to those used in preservatives-free commercial baby food technology, makes this product safe for elderly people, nursing/ pregnant women, and even babies that are ready for solid food. Enjoy!

Magnatum Pico connects with roots of poplar, willow, hazel, oak and hazel trees and the time of its harvest is very short – from September till January. Its skin (peridium) is smooth and ochre yellow or olive yellow in colour, and sometimes it can reveal a more rustic cracked area or light red spots. The gleba (fleshy inner mass) is firm in structure, at the beginning whitish and then pale yellow, ochre brown, reddish brown, streaked with many thin white lines.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen", "image_url": "https://pixabay.com/get/g28a1d6f1b1f316ed3082e30b2f108d1e4d8d456713e42e742cdecaf45a33840a9c7f93a0c5d24547c702226c593a32bcdd3900ae964cb1ffd27fc7d57666844e_1280.jpg"}

How To Cook Salmon in the OvenIngredients:2 – 3 lb skin-on salmon filetOlive oilSaltPepperLemon wedges, to serveInstructions:Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack placed in the middle. Line a baking sheet with foil.Pat the salmon dry with a paper towel.Drizzle some oil over the top of each filet— just enough to coat the salmon — and rub it over the salmon with your fingers or a pastry brush. Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork.
