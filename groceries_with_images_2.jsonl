Pressed is on a mission to make high nutrition a realistic option for all. Our cold-pressed juices are made with all-natural fruits and vegetables - no preservatives and no added sugars. How to cleanse - Although everyone is different and needs to listen to their body as they cleanse, Pressed’s juice plan recommends drinking 1 juice every 2 hours in the following recommended order: Greens with Ginger, Orange Turmeric, Roots with Ginger, Greens with Ginger, Sweet Citrus, Avocado Greens Smoothies. Drink the first one when you wake up in the morning, and try to drink the last one two hours before sleeping. Add one Wellness shot and one Vitality shot at any point of the day to boost your cleanse. Juice cleansing is intended to replace solid meals, though again everyone is different and should consume food, water and juice as they need. Be prepared for changes in your digestion and even sleep rhythms as your body adjusts to the cleanse, and make sure you stay hydrated with water throughout, as you might find shifting energy levels and mood in your first juice cleanse. Green with Ginger - Made from the freshest, highest-quality green vegetables we can find, our green juice is a simple and easy addition to a healthy lifestyle. Leafy green vegetables are known for their antioxidants, phytonutrients, as well as enhancing oxygen transport and serving as a natural source of energy. Our green juice is perfectly blended, so you never have to compromise taste for nutrition. Orange Turmeric - Orange Turmeric is a blend of orange, apple aloe vera, turmeric, lemon, and black pepper. Our Orange Turmeric elevates everyday OJ with a vibrant blend of orange juice, black pepper, and turmeric from Fiji. Roots with Ginger - We've blended carrots and beets to create delicious juices for all taste buds-from earthy to sweet! Known for their rich color and sweet flavor, root vegetables contain powerful benefits that promote liver health, fight free radicals, soothe the nervous system, protect your eyesight, and more! Grown deep in the ground, root vegetables absorb high amounts of vitamins and minerals from the soil. They have distinct, earthy flavors and are packed with fiber and complex carbohydrates, which help the body to break down sugar. Sweet Citrus - Our citrus blend is refreshing, hydrating and crisp. It contains ingredients like lemon and mint that are known to stimulate and alkalize the system, aid in digestion, and provide a pick-me-up when you're feeling down. Avocado Greens Smoothie - Expertly blended and ready to go, this clean and simple recipe is packed with power greens like spinach, kale, and spirulina, mixed with banana, avocado, and matcha for a creamy-smooth taste. Wellness Shots\nThese shots are lemony with a powerful kick from ginger and cayenne. Ginger's spicy goodness contains anti-inflammatory properties that help with circulation, aid in digestion by soothing the stomach and support glowing skin and circulation. Vitality Shots\nThese shots are milder than the wellness shots, sweet and spicy with an earthy aftertaste. Turmeric takes the spotlight here containing a compound called curcumin. Benefit from the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of curcumin to relieve joint pain and muscle aches. 24 Bottles - 18 Juices (12 oz), 6 Shots (2 oz) 6 Greens with Ginger\n3 Orange Turmeric\n3 Roots with Ginger\n3 Sweet Citrus\n3 Avocado Greens\n3 Wellness Shots\n3 Vitality Shots All natural fruits and vegetables\nNo sugars added\nNo preservatives\nHigh-pressured processed (HPP)\nKosher\nIndividually labeled\nKeep refrigerated", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/4040602/pexels-photo-4040602.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

INFORMATIVE VIDEOS help users get started quickly and demonstrate the key features that set Twist and Shout Mop apart.Have you tried traditional mops, spray mops or steam mops and gotten frustrated by how ineffective or overpriced they are? While the traditional mops are affordable, they do not clean well and are difficult to wring. Other mops seem to have you hooked on endless expenditures of proprietary pads and solution refills. And few of the mops can reach the dusty areas under furniture and tight corners.​Twist and Shout Mop is the original self-wringing mop that rotates at up to 2500 rpm. By gently pushing down the aluminum alloy handle, the mop spins dry automatically without touching. Unlike other spin mops, Twist and Shout Mop does NOT have the easily breakable foot petal. Its innovative design has won the gold medals of 2011 iENA International Innovation Award and 2011 INST International Invention Show.The super absorbent mop head is made of over 8,000 strands of microfiber that lock in dust, spills, and stains instead of pushing them around. Microfiber can absorb up to 8X their weight in liquid and cleans 3X better than cotton.The specially designed swivel joint allows the mop head to bend 180 degrees and easily clean the hardest reachable areas under furniture and around tight corners.And the best part of it all? This is a product that is designed for sustainability. It doesn’t require expensive disposable pad refills, special cleaning solutions, batteries, or power. You can clean with just water or any cleaning solution that is safe for your family and pets. Each microfiber mop head lasts up to a year and costs little to replace, minimizing your total cost of ownership compared to other cleaning systems in the market.Be Sure To View The Official Product Demo and Comparison Video Before Purchase", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/3964741/pexels-photo-3964741.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

A place where the door was always open for neighbors to pop by, where there was always a pot of coffee on (a fresh pot every 20 minutes to be exact). That single coffee shop became such a favorite that more locations soon began to open in neighborhoods across Canada, then the US, and now parts all over the world. Tim Hortons Original hasn't changed in over 50 years, and is such a secret that only 3 people (and we're not telling who!) know the recipe.

Spain is the second most mountainous European country after Switzerland, and so Serrano Ham is produced all over the country.When we talk about Serrano ham we do not refer to the general denomination of “cured ham from pigs raised in mountain areas” but, specifically, to a special ham category: which is one that comes from the white pig. The white pig is the result of the crossbreeding of Landrace, Duroc-Jersey, Large White and Blanco Belga, among others. These white pigs are fed with natural fodders, composed of cereals. Their young are controlled until the moment of the animal sacrifice, at the age of about 6 or 7 months, with an approximated weight of 95 to 100 kg.Spain has been producing cured hams for many centuries. Ham is a rooted product in the Spanish history and it can be considered as an essential factor of its culture.The Serrano Ham is produced according to traditional methods that award it a sweet and slightly aromatic palate. Its flavor and its sensory characteristics make it a gastronomic product of its highest quality, guaranteed by a traditional process and a good selection of raw material.Ingredients:Pork ham, sea salt.Storage Conditions:May be refrigerated. Store in a cool and dry place.Consumption:Ham should always be eaten at room temperature (57ºF at 71ºF).After carving, lay the slices on a wooden board and allow them to breathe for at least thirty minutes. This intensifies the flavour for a truly authentic taste. In Spain, Serrano Ham is usually eaten as a \"Tapa\". That is to say, as an aperitif, in small and very thin slices and perhaps accompanied with bread and a red glass of wine or a beer. But Serrano Ham, due to its excellent quality and gastronomically qualities, has inspired renowned chefs around the world to prepare all kinds of recipes (from the simplest to the most sophisticated).", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/17336549/pexels-photo-17336549.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter. Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin. Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers. That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping. What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you. Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/8805856/pexels-photo-8805856.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

Veal Demi-Glace is made from a traditional recipe using veal bones, aromatic vegetables, water, wine and nothing else, and is slow-cooked for many hours, creating concentrated flavor and silky smooth texture.

Whether a steak-searing pro or recipe-reading novice, this gift is perfect for lovers of all things beef and includes helpful tips and recipe ideas to keep the meals coming (hopefully back your way)! Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to prevent overcooking them\nFilet mignon steaks & burgers are recommended cooked rare to medium-rare\nSeason steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine\nMake a quick and easy pan sauce by adding the veal demi-glace in with the pan drippings once steaks are cooked.

Comparisons to other meat sources have shown that bison meat has a greater concentration of iron, zinc and essential fatty acids.\nBison meat is a rich source of complete protein containing all the essential amino acids in appropriate amounts. Each serving contains about 22 grams of protein which is then used in the body to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and some hormones, and maintain cell membranes and components of the immune system.\nRich in Vitamin B12, Selenium, Zinc and Phosphorus, bison meat is also an excellent source of Iron, Vitamin B6 and Niacin, all of which are recommended daily.\nBison meat contains the \"essential fatty acids\", linoleic (omega - 3) and linoleic (omega - 6) fatty acids. These substances are necessary for us to eat but can not be made in our bodies and are thus, commonly lacking. Their function is to assist the formation of cell membranes, aiding in the production of hormone-like compounds, and participating in immune and visual processes.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/7368041/pexels-photo-7368041.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

Imagine a American Wagyu burger on an artisanal brioche burger bun, topped with heritage-breed applewood-smoked bacon and crowned with creamy black truffle butter. Every element of this burger is special, beginning with the beef: D’Artagnan American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. American Wagyu beef offers buttery tenderness from pure Japanese Wagyu genetics, and robust beefy flavor from the small percentage of Certified Black Angus in the herd. It’s the best of both worlds, united in one tenderloin. Just like the burgers, the bacon has impeccable credentials: heritage-breed hogs known for great taste and creamy fat are raised naturally on small family farms. The pork bellies are smoked over real applewood, and are cured without additives or nitrites. This slightly sweet bacon is the perfect topping for the burgers. That would be enough for most, but to take this burger to the extreme, add D’Artagnan’s rich black truffle butter, with its pungent aroma, distinct flavor and aura of luxury for the ultimate burger topping. What can you put these mega-burger ingredients on? Nothing but the best, artisanally-baked brioche buns will do. Not your standard burger bun, these buttery and springy brioche buns work perfectly with the other elements to create the ultimate fantasy burger. Your mouth will thank you. Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to keep from overcooking them\nCook to Desired doneness. We suggest cooking to an internal temperature of 160°f.\nSlowly toast buns that have been smothered in truffle butter\nPrepare bacon on grill over medium heat prior to cooking burgers, careful of flare-ups\nTop off cooked burger with a large dollop of truffle butter", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/8805856/pexels-photo-8805856.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

This impressive gourmet beef package includes cowboy ribeye steaks and Domestic American Wagyu burgers. Included are eight bone-in ribeye steaks, each weighing an impressive 20 -22 ounces. These Choice-grade steaks are wet-aged for twenty-one days to add complexity to the flavor. Each steak is individually packaged so you can save a few for later, or plan a party and use them all at once. D’Artagnan steaks come from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances, and grow at a slow and natural pace. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be. Rounding out this ultimate beef package are twelve 8 ounce Kobe-style beef patties. You’ll be cooking like a star chef with these juicy burgers. The texture of this incredible beef carries a softness that defies description, along with that world-renowned buttery Kobe flavor. The burgers are individually sealed and packaged in twos, so you can store them in the freezer and enjoy luxurious burgers anytime you like. D’Artagnan Domestic American Wagyu beef comes from Wagyu cattle, the same breed that produces the famous Kobe beef of Japan. When raised in the United States, these cattle produce equally tender beef, but are referred to as “ American Kobe-style” or simply “Wagyu.” Raised humanely without antibiotics or hormones, on pasture and finished in the traditional fashion: with incremental amounts of grain that build on the breed’s natural propensity to exquisite and abundant marbling, American Wagyu beef is a tasty treasure. With all these steaks and burgers, it could just be the perfect gift for that person on your list or choose to just enjoy them yourself!Cooking tips: Cook burger patties from frozen state to help ensure to not overcook themBurgers are suggested rare to medium rareSeason steaks simply with salt, pepper and olive oil and allow the extraordinary flavor to shine.

D’Artagnan beef comes from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus breed cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones or any other artificial substances.

So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be. This impressive 19 pound, choice grade, whole Bone-in Ribeye Roast is wet aged for a minimum of 21 days to add complexity and depth to the flavor.

The A5 grade is the highest rating given to Japanese Wagyu, indicating that the meat is exceptionally tender and marbled with fine, evenly distributed fat.\nThe sampler pack includes one Ribeye Steak, one NY Steak, and one Filet Mignon. The Ribeye Steak is a flavorful and juicy cut that comes from the rib section of the cow. It is well-marbled and has a rich, beefy flavor. The NY Steak, also known as New York Strip or Striploin, is a leaner cut that comes from the short loin section of the cow. It is tender and has a mild, but rich flavor. The Filet Mignon, which comes from the tenderloin section, is the most tender cut of the three. It has a delicate, buttery flavor and a fine, buttery texture.\nEach cut in the sampler pack is between 6-12 ounces in size, allowing for a generous tasting of each cut. These cuts are typically prepared using simple seasoning and cooking methods, such as searing on a hot skillet or grill, to allow the natural flavor and tenderness of the meat to shine through.

Sprinkle the salmon generously with salt and pepper.Place the salmon in the roasting pan, skin-side down. Transfer to the oven.Roasting time depends on the thickness, as determined by the thickest part of the salmon filet. For every half-inch of salmon, roast 4 to 6 minutes - 4 minutes will give you salmon that is still a touch rare, 6 minutes will thoroughly cook it.You can also check the doneness of your salmon with a fork. When the salmon flakes easily with a fork, it's ready. If you like, you can use an instant read thermometer to check the fish for doneness.

With three different types of steak included, you’ll expand your repertoire at the grill or in the kitchen.\nThis impressive gourmet package includes single-portion bavette, hanger, and NY strip steaks. Each steak is individually butchered, trimmed, and vacuum-sealed for your convenience. Keep them in the freezer until the mood strikes or a party gathers. Bavette steak - also known as sirloin flap - is a cult favorite with butchers and chefs and is often hard to find in grocery stores. This well-marbled steak is similar to flank and skirt cuts, although much beefier and more supple than either. Try marinating bavette steak and then searing or grilling it. Be sure to slice it against the grain to best enjoy the texture and rich flavor.\nHanger steak is nicknamed butcher’s steak because this especially tender and flavorful cut was so often held back to feed the butcher’s family. The cut is from the short plate under the ribs - a muscle that does little work, so it has a lush texture. Whether you are an accomplished chef or a beginner, pan-searing and grilling hanger steak over high heat is easy, and rewards with a flavor similar to ribeye.\nNY strip steak is among the most popular cuts of beef and comes from the short loin. With its tender texture, the strip steak is a favorite of steakhouses and countless backyard grillers. Enjoy strip steak with eggs for a hearty breakfast, crusted with pepper and pan-seared, or seasoned simply and grilled to rare or medium rare. D’Artagnan beef comes from a group of dedicated ranchers who raise their Angus breed cattle on pastureland, with lots of room to roam. The cattle are never administered antibiotics, hormones, or any other artificial substances. They grow slowly and naturally, so the cattle take a little longer to come to market, but that’s fine with us. A stress-free lifestyle produces tasty results. So you get nothing but clean beefy flavor – just the way it should be.

Each bite of our Authentic Wagyu Filet Mignons will provide a complex beef flavor that you will remember long after you have cleaned your plate. Each bite you will experience an unbelievably tender, intense flavor and mellifluous, “melt-in-your-mouth” texture. Authentic Wagyu's Japanese A5 is imported from Kagoshima, Japan which is located in the far south of Japan. The Kagoshima prefecture is collectively responsible for around 20% of Japan's Kuroge Wagyu cattle, the Wagyu breed that produces Japanese A5 Wagyu. Kagoshima's consistent temperate climate and ecology are well-suited for raising healthy cattle with low stress levels, a necessary component of achieving A5 quality. Kagoshima Wagyu took the top prize at \"The Wagyu Olympics\" this year based on overall contest scores. You could say that Kagoshima's A5 Wagyu is the best beef in Japan right now!If you have never tasted A5 Fullblood Authentic Wagyu, the experience can be next to impossible to describe. The one description beef connoisseurs the world over can agree upon is your opinion as to what a steak should taste like, will be changed forever. With phrases such as, “melts in your mouth”, “beef perfected” and “unlike any other steak I have ever tasted before”.A5 Fullblood Wagyu beef is truly in a league of its own. The legendary, sometimes mythical process of Authentic Wagyu cattle raising in Japan has been handed down through the generations, all in an effort to protect their national treasure. Wagyu (WA meaning Japanese and GYU meaning cow) Beef. Intensely satisfying in small portions, one must taste this beef to really speak to the mouthwatering, buttery flavor with extreme tenderness and smooth texture.The A5 Wagyu steaks secured for our Costco members are the most rare and single most prized beef steaks found globally. In 2016, only 200 metric tons are imported duty free into the United States. With a much smaller percentage of that total weight graded in Japan as A5 quality. The Japanese beef grading scale is quite different than the USDA scale of Select, Choice and Prime. In Japan, there are 12 different categories of beef quality. With the “A5” selection being the best of the very best.Authentic Wagyu in partnership with Costco, has secured this exquisitely distinct beef utilizing their direct relationships with the farmers of Japan, their genetics and mythical process of cattle raising that has been passed down from multiple generations. When you take your first bite of Authentic Wagyu Filet Mignon you will encounter something like never before.Authentic Wagyu has established relationships with all 10 USDA approved processing facilities in Japan. Giving them the advantage of hand selecting the “very best” cuts and grades for our Costco members.Whether it is to be enjoyed with your family, or a party with friends and colleagues, one thing is for certain, everyone will be talking about the “one of a kind” steak you just prepared them and dreaming of when they will be able to experience it again.Features:Authentic Japanese Wagyu BeefImported from the Kagoshima prefecture in JapanProcured by Authentic Wagyu, LLCMarbling far beyond USDA Prime GradeHighest Japanese GradeFilet Mignons, 3 lbs.Package Form: Individually Vacuum SealedProduct is flash frozen before shipping to lock in flavor and will arrive frozen or partially thawedShips UPS Next Day Air (Included)", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/30939971/pexels-photo-30939971.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}

This unique characteristic is the fruit of GOLDEN NEST®, commitment to have all swallow nests be 100% hand-washed and 100% bleaching-free. The 100% hand-washed method is still the time-tested premier method to minimize the impurities content in the nest. This method, however, is losing its popularity due to significant product loss during the cleaning process. Also, some minor impurities might still remain visible, due to the absence of bleaching agents to ‘cover’ them (read: ‘Why Bleaching’ at the back page). However, GOLDEN NEST® believes that the best swallow nest should always be completely natural; to achieve a 100% natural final product, 100% hand-washed raw swallow is the unwavering, ultimate standard. Finally, the absence of bleaching agents, along with advanced cooking technology similar to those used in preservatives-free commercial baby food technology, makes this product safe for elderly people, nursing/ pregnant women, and even babies that are ready for solid food.

The Southern European white truffle, Tuber Magnatum Pico is one of the most renowned in the world, and gourmets and culinary connoisseurs are increasingly attracted by this amazing truffle.It is the most exclusive edible truffle in the world. Magnatum Pico connects with roots of poplar, willow, hazel, oak and hazel trees and the time of its harvest is very short – from September till January. Its skin (peridium) is smooth and ochre yellow or olive yellow in colour, and sometimes it can reveal a more rustic cracked area or light red spots. The gleba (fleshy inner mass) is firm in structure, at the beginning whitish and then pale yellow, ochre brown, reddish brown, streaked with many thin white lines. Intensive in scent and strong but pleasant in flavor. For best storing: wrap each truffle singularly in paper towel, place them inside a glass jar, and store in your fridge. Replace the paper towel daily. Remember: Truffles do not like humidity! Truffle is underground tuberous fungus, considered to be the height of gastronomy. It grows in the heart of central and southern Europe, in a humid and grey soil of the European forests.

If you are among its many fans, you’ll rediscover its charms with D’Artagnan Certified-Humane Green Circle™ Chicken breast. This chicken is exclusively and humanely raised for D’Artagnan on small farms in the Amish community in free-range conditions without the use of any antibiotics or hormones. Old-fashioned methods are used to create a truly modern – and richly flavored – chicken. D’Artagnan’s Green Circle chicken program brings back the methods of family farms from over a century ago, when chickens lived on vegetable scraps and roamed freely around farmyards and pastureland. Inspired by that common-sense, waste-nothing philosophy, the chickens are raised on a diet of locally collected vegetables and trimmings. No growth hormones, tranquilizers, arsenicals or antibiotics are ever used. The chicken is also air-chilled during processing, which is vastly different from the industry standard in the U.S. where chickens are immersed in vats of cold water - which causes the chicken to absorb water and dilute the flavor, while also severely increasing the risk of cross-contamination. Air-chilled chicken is cooled by passing the birds through several chambers where cold, purified air is used to cool the meat - resulting in no added moisture, stronger flavor and less chance for contamination. The natural juices are not diluted, so the meat is more tender and flavorful. When you buy water-chilled chicken, you are paying for water—on average 8% of its body weight. But with air-chilling, all you pay for is chicken.Certified-humane chicken - No antibiotics or hormones addedRaised on small farms; diet is supplemented with locally collected vegetable scrapsAir-chilled for maximum flavor concentration24 breasts (2 breasts per pack; 12 packs per kit)12 packs, 11 lbs total minimum weightShips uncooked & frozen", "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/7368041/pexels-photo-7368041.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940"}
